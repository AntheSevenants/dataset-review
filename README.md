# dataset-review
Review a dataset one record at a time

This is a simple CSV file viewer which shows you one record of your CSV file at a time. If you need to review a dataset manually, reviewing becomes much more intuitive in this way, allowing you to focus at one item at a time.

## How to use

1. Go to the [dataset-review webpage](https://anthesevenants.github.io/dataset-review/)
2. Click "Choose File" and select your CSV dataset

Is your CSV file delimited by a delimiter other than `,`? Add `?delimiter=` to the URL and specify your own delimiter. E.g. if your delimiter is a semicolon, the url should be `https://anthesevenants.github.io/dataset-review/?delimiter=;`.
